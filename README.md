This is an image gallery section that slides in different timings and uses a soft parallax effect. It was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Framer Motion. The functionality of the gallery was inspired by Olivier Larose's <a href="https://blog.olivierlarose.com/demos/smooth-parallax-scroll" target="_blank">Parallax scroll</a>
